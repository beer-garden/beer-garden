# Beer Garden Changelog

## 3.11.0

2/9/22

### Added Features
- Updates in status in the user interface (via WebSockets) are now filtered according to a user's authorization, the same as HTTP API requests. (Issue #1243)
- The user interface now preemptively refreshes user access tokens so that a user will not be automatically logged out after a short period of inactivity. (Issue #1247)
- User interface elements are now hidden or displayed according to a user's authorization to access their functionality. (Issue #1179 & Issue #1250)
- Users can now import and export Garden connection configurations via the user interface. (Issue #1192 & Issue #1141)

### Bug Fixes
- The Job error count now correctly also reflects those Jobs that fail due to an exception,  (Issue #1225)
- Job scheduler request handling now properly keeps track of which requests have finished. (Issue #1214)

### Other Changes
- Added basic documentation for authentication and authorization features added to Beer-garden in previous releases. (Issue #1241)

## 3.10.0

1/4/22

### Added Features

- File parameters on requests are now cleaned up by the pruner per the
  `db.ttl.file` setting. (Issue #1215)
- File parameters are now cleaned up when the corresponding request is removed.
  (Issue #1215)
- Reduce log noise generated from ERROR events. (Issue #1213)

### Bug Fixes

- Request parameter and output data stored in GridFS no longer gets duplicated
  throughout the life of a request. (Issue #1216)
- Request `status_updated_at` field on requests from child gardens is now
  properly preserved. (Issue #1143)
- The DELETE method on the /api/v1/gardens endpoint has been restored. (Issue
  #1230)

### Other Changes

- Added backend support for a command publishing blocklist that prevents
  requests from listed commands from being published up to a parent garden. User
  access to this feature will follow in a future release. (Issue #877)

## 3.9.0

12/8/21

### Added Features

- The `status_updated_at` timestamp is now displayed on the Request view page.
  (Issue #1142)
- The `/api/v1/job/<id>/execute` endpoint now takes an optional `reset_interval`
  parameter which, when set to true, will update the next run time of an
  interval trigger job to be based on the current adhoc execution, rather than
  keeping the next run time that was based on the previously scheduled
  execution. (Issue #1173)
- Command parameters of type `Bytes` are now rendered as a file upload dialog in
  the tasking interface. Files provided this way will be properly sent down to
  remote gardens for tasking, unlike the `Base64` paramter type. For this
  reason, it is recommended that `Bytes` be used for parameters that intend to
  take a file as input. (Issue #1165)

### Bug Fixes

- Child requests are once again properly returned via the `/api/v1/request`
  endpoint and properly displayed on the request page in the UI (Issue #1218)

### Other Changes

- Added the following for use in future authorization related features:
  - A trusted header login handler for authenticating users based on request
    headers that indicate the username and a list of group memberships. (Issue
    #1198)
  - Improved handling of refresh tokens in the UI (Issue #1187)
  - Add authorization checks to the `/api/v1/forward` endpoint. (Issue #1207)
