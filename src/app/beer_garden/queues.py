"""Queue Service

The queue service is responsible for:

* Queue CRUD operations
* Publishing requests

Much like the persistence layer, the queue service helps keep the rest of the subsystems
from understanding anything about the queueing mechanism being used by a particular system.
As such, it is responsible for providing an API which is consistent across each queue
technology we use.
