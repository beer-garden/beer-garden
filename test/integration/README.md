# Integration Testing

These tests are meant to ensure that the different parts of Beer-garden work correctly together.

## Running Locally

If you're running Beer-garden locally you can also run these tests yourself. Just modify `rest/config.json` to tell the tests where to find your Beer-garden and make sure you have `pytest` installed. Run `pytest rest` to kick things off.

## Parts

These tests are targeting different aspects of beergarden.

### Config

These make sure that configuration file generation / upgrades work properly

#### Defaults

These are the files that should be generated by default

#### Migration

Each directory is a version.

The config files that are immediate children are config files that were used for that version.

Then there are additional version directories that are also direct children. The config files in those represent what a config file upgraded FROM that version would look like.

For example:
The 2.3.5 directory has configs file in it. These are files that would work with version 2.3.5.

The 2.4.0 directory also has configs. These are files that would work with version 2.4.0. However, the 2.4.0 directory also has a 2.3.6 directory. Those files are the "truth" for what upgrading a config file from 2.3.6 to 2.4.0 should look like.

Then run the tests and correct any discrepencies.

### Upgrade

TODO
These test upgrading beer-garden from one version to another
